# Recursion-JS

[Javascript - Recursion Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion)

The purpose of this project was to solve a problem (Fibonacci Sequence) both iteratively and recursively. The second part of the project was to build a simple mergeSort algorithm that takes in an array and returns the sorted array.
